# Discord Webhook Setup for Asking Card

This guide will help you set up Discord notifications for when new cards are created. The bot will appear as "‡∏û‡∏µ‡πà‡∏ö‡∏≤‡∏™‡∏Ñ‡∏£‡∏±‡∏ö‡∏ú‡∏°‡∏°‡∏µ‡∏Ñ‡∏≥‡∏ñ‡∏≤‡∏°" and will notify about both text and file submissions.

## Step 1: Create a Discord Webhook

1. **Open your Discord server** where you want to receive notifications
2. **Go to Server Settings** (click the server name ‚Üí Server Settings)
3. **Navigate to Integrations** in the left sidebar
4. **Click on "Webhooks"**
5. **Click "Create Webhook"**
6. **Configure your webhook:**
   - **Name:** Asking Card Bot (or any name you prefer)
   - **Channel:** Choose the channel where notifications should appear
   - **Avatar:** Optional - you can upload a custom image
7. **Copy the Webhook URL** - you'll need this for the next step

## Step 2: Configure Environment Variables

1. **Open the `.env.local` file** in your project root
2. **Replace `your_discord_webhook_url_here`** with your actual webhook URL:

```env
# Discord Webhook Configuration
DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL=https://discord.com/api/webhooks/YOUR_WEBHOOK_URL_HERE
DISCORD_NOTIFICATIONS_ENABLED=true
```

## Step 3: Test the Integration

1. **Start your servers:**
   ```bash
   npm run server  # Terminal 1
   npm run dev     # Terminal 2
   ```

2. **Create a test card** in your application
3. **Check your Discord channel** - you should see a notification with:
   - Card topic
   - Card description
   - Timestamp
   - Asking Card branding

## Notification Features

The Discord notifications include:
- ‚ú® **Rich embed format** with clean styling
- üìù **Card topic and description** 
- üìé **File attachment info** (filename and size when files are uploaded)
- ‚è∞ **Timestamp** when the card was created
- üé® **Black color theme** matching your app
- ü§ñ **Thai bot name** ("‡∏û‡∏µ‡πà‡∏ö‡∏≤‡∏™‡∏Ñ‡∏£‡∏±‡∏ö‡∏ú‡∏°‡∏°‡∏µ‡∏Ñ‡∏≥‡∏ñ‡∏≤‡∏°")
- üí¨ **Custom footer message** in Thai

## Troubleshooting

### Notifications not appearing?
1. Check that `DISCORD_NOTIFICATIONS_ENABLED=true` in `.env.local`
2. Verify your webhook URL is correct and complete
3. Check the server console for error messages
4. Ensure the webhook hasn't been deleted from Discord

### Server console messages:
- ‚úÖ `Discord notification sent successfully` - Working correctly
- ‚ö†Ô∏è `Discord notifications disabled or webhook URL not configured` - Check your environment variables
- ‚ùå `Failed to send Discord notification: [error]` - Check webhook URL and Discord server permissions

## Disabling Notifications

To temporarily disable Discord notifications without removing the webhook URL:

```env
DISCORD_NOTIFICATIONS_ENABLED=false
```

The application will continue working normally, just without Discord notifications.
